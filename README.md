# Spring Batch Example Project

This is a simple Spring Batch example project demonstrating basic operations with Spring Batch. Spring Batch is a lightweight, comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the development of robust batch applications.

## Overview

In this project, you will find examples of various basic operations achievable with Spring Batch:

### 1. Tasklets

Tasklets are simple units of work that perform a single task. In this project, we demonstrate how to create and use tasklets to execute specific tasks within a batch job.

### 2. ItemReader and ItemWriter

Spring Batch provides `ItemReader` and `ItemWriter` interfaces for reading and writing data in batch processing. We illustrate the usage of these interfaces with simple examples to read data from a source and write it to a destination.

### 3. JUnit Testing for Spring Batch Jobs

Testing batch jobs is crucial for ensuring their correctness and reliability. This project includes examples of using `SpringBatchTest` annotation and JUnit to test Spring Batch jobs. We demonstrate how to write unit tests for batch jobs to validate their behavior.

### 4. MySQL Queries for Spring Batch Tables

Spring Batch uses database tables to store batch metadata and execution information. To set up and manage these tables, we provide MySQL queries that generate the necessary tables for Spring Batch. Additionally, we include scripts for truncating and dropping these tables, which can be useful for cleaning up or resetting the batch environment.
